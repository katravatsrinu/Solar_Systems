üåû Realistic 3D rendering of the Sun with glow effect

ü™ê All 8 planets with accurate relative sizes and distances

‚è±Ô∏è Adjustable speed controls for each planet (0-5x speed)

‚èØÔ∏è Play/Pause and Reset buttons

üñ±Ô∏è Interactive camera controls (drag to rotate, scroll to zoom)

‚ú® Starfield background

üõ∞Ô∏è Visible orbit paths for each planet

üì± Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile

How to Use
Save the file:

Copy the entire HTML code

Paste it into a text editor

Save as solar-system.html

Run the simulation:

Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended)

No internet connection required after saving the file

Technical Details
Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript - no frameworks or build tools needed

Uses Three.js (loaded from CDN) for 3D rendering

WebGL-based with hardware acceleration

Responsive design adapts to screen size

File size: ~12KB (without Three.js CDN)

Customization Options
You can easily modify the simulation by editing these parts of the code:

Planet properties (around line 300):

Change sizes, distances, colors, or speeds

Add new planets by copying the planet object format

Visual effects:

Adjust star density (line 270)

Change sun glow intensity (line 350)

Modify orbit ring appearance (line 410)

Performance:

Reduce star count for better performance on mobile

Disable shadows if needed (line 220)

Browser Support
Works best in modern browsers that support WebGL:

Chrome

Firefox

Edge

Safari

Mobile browsers (with reduced performance)
